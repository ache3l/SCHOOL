                  <p>The Massacre in the Great Temple marked a major shift in Aztec-Spanish relations, which had, up until then, been largely friendly. Panfilo de Narvaez had been ordered to come to the Aztec Empire and arrest Hernan Cortes, forcing Cortes to leave to fight him. While the Aztecs celebrated Toxcatl, an Aztec festivity, after receiving permission from Pedro de Alvarado, the deputy governor in place of Cortes, the Spanish soon entered the Great Temple and massacred almost all in attendance. The few who escaped over the walls described the Spanish atrocity to the community. The Massacre at the Great Temple represented a breakdown in Spanish-Aztec relations.</p>

The creation of New spain catipulted the Spanish into fame and positiosn of power, while the Aztecs faced an almost complete wipeout of their culture and the fall of one of the largest cities at that time.</td>

For the Aztecs, it meant the destruction of their culture, their way of life and the beginning of centuries of colonial rule and oppression. The Spaniards dismantled the Aztec temples and palaces, replacing them with Christian churches and Spanish government buildings, effectively erasing physical symbols of Aztec power and religion.</td>

                            <td class="border px-4 py-3">The fall of Tenochtitlan had far-reaching effects, impacting not only the 200,000 inhabitants of the Tenochtitlan but also neighboring tribes in the region, adding up to around 25 million affected. These tribes, whether through alliances, trade relationships, or conquest, were all connected in some way to the Tenochtitlan. The collapse of Tenochtitlan destabilized this intricate network, leading to shifts in power which lead to upheavals in social structures. For the Spanish, the conquest of Tenochtitlan was a pivotal moment that catapulted them into positions of immense wealth, power, and fame. The riches plundered from the Aztec capital, paired with the fame of defeating the superpower in the region, elevated Spain's status in Europe, which fueled further expeditions to the colony of "New Spain" and the rest of the world. The conquest also marked the beginning of centuries of Spanish exploitation and colonisation of the Americas.

Even though the siege only lasted for about three months, the defeat had long-lasting effects and marked the beginning of spanish colonisation of the Americas. Mexico City emerged from the ruins of Tenochtitlan, its foundations built upon the ruins of a once-great civilization. </td>

This butterfly effect led to the creation of Mexico City, the Spanish colonial rule over the America's and loss of Aztec culture. The fall of the Tenochtitlan and the aftermath of destruction means that the people of Mexico have little Aztec heritage, which is why most people in Mexico speak Spanish.</td>
